    bullets: [
      "The new iPhone introduces a revolutionary Self-Healing Long-Life Battery, redefining mobile energy standards. Unlike conventional batteries that degrade after a couple of years, this technology ensures your iPhone’s battery remains reliable and efficient even after years of daily charging cycles.",
      "At the core of this feature lies nano-level self-repairing materials. Over time, batteries naturally form micro-cracks and chemical buildup that weaken performance. The self-healing mechanism detects these weaknesses and automatically repairs them, restoring the battery’s structural integrity.",
      "This drastically reduces the rate of degradation, giving users up to five years of consistent battery health."

      "Security is no longer about protecting against today’s hackers but also preparing for tomorrow’s. The iPhone now introduces Quantum-Safe Security, the next frontier in digital privacy.",
      "Traditional encryption methods, while strong today, may become vulnerable once quantum computers reach maturity. This innovation ensures your data is safeguarded against even the most advanced future threats.",
      "At its foundation lies post-quantum cryptography, a cutting-edge encryption method resistant to the immense computing power of quantum machines. While regular hackers use brute force or algorithms to crack security, quantum computers could theoretically bypass current encryption standards within minutes."

      "Perhaps the most futuristic addition is the Holographic Mode, which turns your iPhone into a portable 3D projection device. Imagine holding your phone and projecting life-like holograms directly into your environment — this is now possible.",
      "Using advanced nano-lens projection technology, the iPhone creates 3D holograms that can be viewed without glasses or headsets. Whether it’s projecting a movie scene into your living room, visualizing a 3D model for work, or having a FaceTime call where the other person appears as a hologram right in front of you, the experience is breathtaking.",
